<h2>Hobbies</h2> 

<p>Freelance Work:</p>
<p>In my "spare" time, I'm always looking for new opportunities to work on freelance pieces. I started my freelance career at age 19 when I started Journalism School, and I've kept up ever since. See examples of my work below:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://woodburymag.com/plant-shopping-primer-gertens">A Plant Shopping Primer from Gertens</dt></a>
<dd> This is a short piece I wrote for my local hometown magazine. It gives an overview of some of the most popular gardening terms you might see when shopping for plant.</dd>  
<dt><a href="https://woodburymag.com/luxury-living-affordable-price-legends-woodbury-now-open">Luxury Living at an Affordable Price</dt></a>
<dd> This is another short piece I wrote for the same magazine where I covered the opening of a new senior living home.</dd>

<p>Cooking</p>  

<p>While I'm no professional chef, one of my favorite pastimes is to experiment in the kitchen. I love trying new recipies and experimenting with new flavors. Some of my favorite recipies are linked below:</p>   

<dl>
 <dt><a href="https://cookieandkate.com/creamy-vegan-butternut-squash-linguine-with-fried-sage/">Butternut Squash Pasta Sauce</dt></a>

<dd> This butternut squash pasta sauce is one of my favorite fall recipies (but honestly, I'll make it year round!). It's a fun twist on typical pasta sacue, and pairs well with grilled or roasted chicken for some extra protein.</dd>   
 <dt><a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a48247/cilantro-lime-chicken-recipe/">Cilantro Lime Skillet Chicken</dt></a>
<dd> Cilantro-Lime is a fantastic flavor combination, and when paired with chicken, some rice, and maybe a little guacamole and tortilla chips, it makes the perfect lunch or dinnner.</dd>    

<dt><a href="https://producemadesimple.ca/savoury-carrot-and-black-bean-burgers/">Black Bean Burgers</dt></a>
<dd>Vegetarian, but still want a good burger? No worries! I love making this black bean and carrot burger when I don't have any meat in the house, or just feel like something a little different.</dd>
